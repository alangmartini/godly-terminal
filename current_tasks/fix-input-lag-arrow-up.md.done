# Fix ~2s input lag on arrow-up and rapid keystrokes

## Branch: `feat/worktree-open-terminal-btn`
## PR: https://github.com/alangmartini/godly-terminal/pull/73
## Status: DONE

## Problem

`write_to_terminal` blocked the Tauri thread pool waiting for the daemon's `Ok` response on every keystroke. Under rapid input (e.g. arrow-up), threads saturated on IPC round-trips, causing compounding delays up to ~2s.

## Fix

1. Added `send_fire_and_forget()` to `DaemonClient` — enqueues request without blocking on response.
2. `write_to_terminal` uses fire-and-forget instead of `send_request()`.
3. Replaced `requestAnimationFrame` (~16ms) with `setTimeout(0)` (~1ms) for output buffer flushing.
